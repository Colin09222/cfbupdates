                <p>Terry Bussey arrived at Texas A&M as a quiet freshman who barely saw the field — zero carries, zero yards, just a name buried on a depth chart. He transferred to Wyoming after one season and sat behind the starters for another year, managing just 1 carry for 2 yards in 2026. Nobody expected what came next.</p>
                <p>In 2027, Bussey didn't just emerge — he <em>detonated</em>. Under Charlie Kirk's chaotic regime in Laramie, the 5'10" dynamo from Timpson, Texas rushed for <strong>1,956 yards</strong> on 161 carries with <strong>19 touchdowns</strong>, averaging a jaw-dropping 12.1 yards per carry with a 100-yard long run. He added 10 receptions for 151 yards and 3 receiving TDs for good measure. He won the Heisman Trophy, the Doak Walker Award, the Maxwell Award, AND the Walter Camp Award in a single season — the most decorated one-year breakout in dynasty history.</p>
                <p>Kirk, of course, credited the success to "AIPAC-funded nutrition science" and "playing with the passion of the Israeli Defense Forces." Bussey just smiled and kept running.</p>

                <p>Tavien St. Clair didn't just play quarterback for Colorado State — he <em>was</em> Colorado State. The 6'4", 236-pound dual-threat from Bellefontaine, Ohio arrived under Coach Thad Castle's powder-fueled program and immediately became the most dominant signal-caller in dynasty history.</p>
                <p>As a redshirt freshman in 2026, St. Clair threw for <strong>5,245 yards and 57 touchdowns</strong> while leading the Rams to a <strong>16-0 record and the National Championship</strong>, demolishing Bowling Green 64-28 in the title game. Thad celebrated by allegedly doing lines off the championship trophy — a claim he neither confirmed nor denied. "I was BLACKED OUT but we WON. HALF BACK TOSS!" he screamed at the post-game presser.</p>
                <p>In 2027, St. Clair followed up with another elite season: <strong>4,556 yards and 49 TDs</strong> with a ridiculous 229.9 passer rating across 13 games. He led Colorado State to another SEC Championship, though the Rams fell short in the playoff this time around. His two-year totals are staggering: <strong>9,801 passing yards, 106 touchdowns</strong>, and a career passer rating over 220. He's still only a redshirt sophomore — but with a 97 OVR, the NFL came calling early.</p>

HALF BACK TOSS!" Security escorted him out. St. Clair just laughed and put on the Patriots hat.</p>

                <p>Arlis Boardingham is, was, and forever will be the greatest tight end in dynasty history. Period. The man rewrote the record books at Bowling Green under Coach Diddy's unhinged leadership, retiring as the <strong>all-time leader in both receiving yards (2,522) and receiving touchdowns (36)</strong>.</p>
                <p>Boardingham was the security blanket, the deep threat, and the red zone nightmare all rolled into one. Diddy called him "my SON, my BROTHER, my OILED-UP WARRIOR" on multiple occasions, often while visibly weeping. When Boardingham graduated, Diddy held an impromptu press conference where he accused the NFL of "STEALING my baby" and threatened to "oil up Roger Goodell personally."</p>
                <p>No player in dynasty history has meant more to a program — or to an emotionally unstable coach — than Arlis Boardingham.</p>
