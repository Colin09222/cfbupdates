        <h1 class="article-title">Kirk Following 56-6 Blowout of New Mexico: "We Have High IQ, Respectful Players. Diddy Has Uneducated Hood Rat Thugs"</h1>
        <img src="../images/kirk_week11.jpg" alt="Coach Charlie Kirk Press Conference" class="article-image">
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>LARAMIE, WY — Wyoming head coach Charlie Kirk had plenty to celebrate after his Cowboys demolished New Mexico 56-6 on Saturday, but he seemed more interested in continuing his ongoing feud with Bowling Green's Sean "Diddy" Combs. What started as routine postgame comments quickly devolved into Kirk's most explicitly racist tirade yet, drawing immediate condemnation from civil rights organizations, university administrators, and the NCAA itself.</p>
            
            <p>On the field, Wyoming was dominant in every phase. Quarterback Kaden Anderson was efficient, completing 20 of 29 passes for 271 yards and 3 touchdowns with just 1 interception. The Cowboys rushing attack was even more impressive, with Terron Kellman leading the charge — the team piled up 278 yards and 4 touchdowns on the ground at an absurd 18.5 yards per carry. Wyoming's defense held New Mexico to just 155 total yards and 6 points, forcing multiple turnovers and recording several sacks.</p>
            
            <div class="score-box">
                <h3>Final Score</h3>
                <p><strong>Wyoming: 56</strong></p>
                <p>New Mexico: 6</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9rem;">WYO - K. Anderson: 20/29, 271 YDS, 3 TD, 1 INT</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">WYO Rushing: 15-278-4 (15 carries, 278 yards, 4 TD)</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">WYO Total Offense: 549 yards (12.5 YPP)</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">WYO 3rd Down: 2-6 (33%)</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The Cowboys' offensive efficiency was remarkable, averaging 12.5 yards per play while New Mexico managed just 2.8. Wyoming recorded 20 first downs to New Mexico's 9 and dominated time of possession. The 56-6 final score represents the largest margin of victory in Kirk's tenure, and the Cowboys move to 7-3 on the season with bowl eligibility already secured. Kellman's performance keeps him atop the national rushing leaderboard with 1,814 yards on the season.</p>
            
            <p>But instead of praising his team's performance, Kirk used the postgame platform to launch a vicious attack on Diddy and Bowling Green. When asked about the key to Wyoming's success, Kirk launched into a monologue about "high IQ football" versus "raw athletic thuggery," making barely-veiled references to race throughout. He specifically cited Bowling Green as an example of a "DEI program" that recruits based on "physical tools rather than mental capacity."</p>
            
            <p>The comments have sparked outrage across college football. The Mountain West Conference has announced an investigation, and Wyoming's Board of Trustees has called an emergency meeting for Monday morning. Several Wyoming players have reportedly approached athletic director Tom Burman expressing discomfort with their coach's statements. A petition calling for Kirk's termination has already gathered over 50,000 signatures. Kirk, for his part, appears unconcerned, telling reporters "the truth hurts" as he left the press room.</p>

                <h3>Press Conference Transcript</h3>
                
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Coach, what was the key to today's dominant performance?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Simple. We have high IQ, respectful players who understand the game. Cerebral guys. Gym rats. First ones in, last ones out. Real students of the game. Meanwhile, you look at teams like New Mexico, like Bowling Green with Coach Diddy... they have uneducated hood rat thugs who rely on raw talent. No discipline. No mental capacity. Just athletes. We beat athletes with intelligence."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: That's a strong statement. Can you elaborate on what you mean?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Look, I'm just saying what everyone's thinking. Our guys are sneaky athletic. Deceptively quick. High football IQ. They come from good families, good backgrounds. They study film. Diddy's guys? They're talented, sure. Raw ability. But they're thugs. Low IQ. Can't read a playbook. Probably can't read at all. That's not racist, that's just facts. We recruit differently."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Are you concerned about the backlash these comments might generate?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Backlash from who? The woke mob? The DEI police? I don't care. Someone has to speak the truth. Programs like Bowling Green are affirmative action football. They get athletes handed to them based on demographics, not merit. We actually develop players. We teach them. Because our guys are capable of learning. Not everyone is."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Diddy's team just put up 49 points and 549 yards today. Doesn't that suggest they can execute?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Against Eastern Michigan. Wow. Impressive. *sarcastic* Look, any group of athletic thugs can put up numbers against weak competition. That's not football. That's backyard ball. Our 56-6 win today? That's disciplined, high-IQ football. We executed. We didn't just rely on being faster than the other guy. We out-thought them."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Do you have any regrets about your Civil Rights Act comments from earlier this week?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"None. The Civil Rights Act has been used to justify DEI hiring, DEI recruiting, DEI refereeing. You think it's a coincidence we lost to Colorado State with three minority refs making questionable calls? I'm just asking questions. Questions that the mainstream media won't ask. Because they're scared. I'm not scared. The truth will set you free."</p>
