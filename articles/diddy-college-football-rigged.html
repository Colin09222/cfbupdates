        <h1 class="article-title">DIDDY UNLEASHED: "College Football Is RIGGED" - Bowling Green Coach Targets West Virginia Racist Hillbilly Program</h1>
        
        <img src="../images/diddy-rant.jpg" alt="Diddy Ranting" style="width: 100%; max-height: 400px; object-fit: cover; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 8px;">
        
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>From his lawyer's office (while "oiling himself up" and preparing for his bail hearing), Sean "Diddy" Combs went on an UNHINGED 45-minute rant about the corrupt state of college football, conspiracy theories, and his newfound obsession with destroying the West Virginia University football program, which he calls "a racist hillbilly institution that's been rigging games for DECADES."</p>

            <p>"College football is NOT college football anymore," Diddy began, his voice rising. "It's RIGGED. The whole thing is a CONSPIRACY. You got NCAA refs in the back taking MONEY. You got coaches buying championships. You got a system designed to keep Black coaches OUT and hillbilly crackers IN. And West Virginia? Man, don't even get me STARTED on West Virginia."</p>

            <div class="rant-box">
                <strong>"I'm telling you right now,"</strong> Diddy screamed into his phone, which he was apparently recording on for "evidence," <strong>"West Virginia is the most RACIST, CORRUPT, HILLBILLY program in college football! Those motherf***ers have been CHEATING since the 1980s! They got a coach up there that looks like he wrestled a bear and LOST! And the NCAA lets them GET AWAY WITH IT because they're in Appalachia and everybody's SCARED to say anything!"</strong>
            </div>

            <p>Diddy's rant about WVU was so intense that his lawyer reportedly told him to "please stop incriminating yourself with conspiracy theories while we're literally preparing your drug possession defense," but Diddy was undeterred.</p>

            <div class="conspiracy-section">
                <h3>DIDDY'S CONSPIRACY THEORIES: The Full Breakdown</h3>
                
                <div class="conspiracy-item">
                    <p class="conspiracy-title">1. The West Virginia Cheating Scandal</p>
                    <p class="conspiracy-text">"West Virginia has been using illegal recruiting tactics for 40 YEARS! They pay players in coal money! They got slush funds hidden in the mountains! The NCAA KNOWS about it but doesn't do anything because they're SCARED of the Appalachian Mafia! I got PROOF! Well, I don't have proof, but I KNOW it's real!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="conspiracy-item">
                    <p class="conspiracy-title">2. The Ref Betting Scheme</p>
                    <p class="conspiracy-text">"Every referee in college football is BETTING on games! That's why calls are so BIASED! The West Virginia refs specifically get PAID to help WVU win! I saw it on Twitter! Some guy said it was real! That's basically evidence!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="conspiracy-item">
                    <p class="conspiracy-title">3. The Racist Coach Alliance</p>
                    <p class="conspiracy-text">"There's a SECRET ALLIANCE of racist hillbilly coaches in the Big 12 that work TOGETHER to keep Black schools from winning! They meet in the mountains! They have MEETINGS! West Virginia is the HEADQUARTERS of this racist conspiracy! I don't have names, but I KNOW they're meeting!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="conspiracy-item">
                    <p class="conspiracy-title">4. The NCAA Cover-Up</p>
                    <p class="conspiracy-text">"The NCAA is COMPLICIT! They KNOW about the West Virginia cheating but they DON'T investigate because the NCAA president is COUSINS with the WVU athletic director! I read it somewhere! Maybe! I'm pretty sure!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="conspiracy-item">
                    <p class="conspiracy-title">5. The Oil Conspiracy</p>
                    <p class="conspiracy-text">"I'm gonna oil myself up and EXPOSE West Virginia! Oil unlocks the TRUTH! When I get out of here, I'm oiling up DAILY and tweeting EVIDENCE of the WVU conspiracy! They FEAR a man with oil and a phone!"</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Diddy's lawyer reportedly put his head in his hands at this point and asked if they could "PLEASE focus on your ACTUAL charges," but Diddy was in full conspiracy mode.</p>

            <p>"Colorado State is the ONLY real champion in college football!" Diddy continued. "Thad Castle is a GENIUS! That man is HIGH all the time and STILL has a better program than West Virginia! Why? Because Thad doesn't cheat! Because Colorado State doesn't have hillbilly RACISTS running the athletic department!"</p>

            <p>When asked if he had any ACTUAL evidence of West Virginia cheating, Diddy paused, then said: "I got VIBES, baby. I got FEELS. And my VIBES are TELLING me that West Virginia is corrupt as HELL. You know what that is? That's EVIDENCE. That's what they call a GUT FEELING, and my GUT FEELING has NEVER been wrong."</p>

            <div class="rant-box">
                <strong>"When I get out of this federal prison,"</strong> Diddy concluded, his eyes wild, <strong>"I'm gonna SUE West Virginia football. I'm gonna SUE the NCAA. I'm gonna SUE EVERYBODY. And I'm gonna do it while OILED UP because oil gives you POWER. OILED UP POWER! That's my new movement! I'm starting a foundation. The 'Oiled Up Victims of College Football Conspiracy' foundation. I'll be the FIRST member because I'M a victim of the RIGGED system!"</strong>
            </div>

            <p>Diddy's legal team has reportedly asked him to stop making public statements until his trial, but insiders say he's been "oiling himself up in the holding cell at the federal courthouse" and planning to file a 500-page conspiracy lawsuit against West Virginia University, the NCAA, the Big 12, and "anyone who's ever helped West Virginia cheat."</p>

            <p>West Virginia's athletic director released a statement saying: "We are aware of Sean Combs' conspiracy allegations and find them to be baseless. However, we will not dignify these claims with a response while Mr. Combs is facing serious federal charges. We wish him well in his legal proceedings."</p>

            <p>Colorado State coach Thad Castle, when informed of Diddy's support, responded: "That man's INSANE but he's RIGHT about West Virginia! Those hillbilly motherf***ers CHEAT! But honestly, Diddy needs to STOP talking about conspiracies and start talking about getting an ACTUAL LAWYER because the feds don't care about your GUT FEELINGS, buddy!"</p>

            <p>Diddy's bail hearing is scheduled for next week. His legal team is requesting that he be allowed to bring a bottle of oil into the courthouse "for emotional support."</p>
