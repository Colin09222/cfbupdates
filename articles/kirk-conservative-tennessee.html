        <h1 class="article-title">"We're Playing More Conservative" - Kirk's Bold Strategy: Gerrymandering Out The Libs</h1>
        
        <img src="../images/kirk-cowboy.jpg" alt="Coach Kirk" class="featured-img">
        
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>In a stunning 41-36 upset over #17 Tennessee, University of Wyoming head coach Charlie Kirk revealed the secret to his team's hot 3-0 start: recruiting exclusively conservative players and "gerrymandering out the snowflake libs" from his roster.</p>

            <p>When asked about Wyoming's dramatic shift in performance—the Cowboys were 5-3 last season and near the bottom of recruiting rankings—Kirk didn't mince words. "We're playing more conservative football," he said, eyes gleaming. "What I mean by that is we don't have many liberals on the team. In a sense, we're gerrymandering out the snowflake libs and putting in real patriots. We need to play CONSERVATIVE, PRO-LIFE, football."</p>

            <div class="score-box">
                <h3>Final Score: Wyoming 41, Tennessee 36</h3>
                <p><strong>Game Stats:</strong></p>
                <p>Wyoming: 27 first downs, 485 total yards, 58 plays, 8.4 yards per play</p>
                <p>Tennessee: 14 first downs, 392 total yards, 44 plays, 8.9 yards per play</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stat-highlight">
                <strong>Wyoming Rushing:</strong> T. Bussey carried 22 times for 159 yards and 1 TD. The ground game was relentless, totaling 289 rushing yards on 37 carries with 2 touchdowns as Kirk's "conservative players" literally ran over Tennessee's defense.
            </div>

            <div class="stat-highlight">
                <strong>Wyoming Passing:</strong> Blake Barnett completed 15-21 (71%) for 196 yards and 4 TDs. Chris Durr Jr. led receivers with 4 catches for 76 yards and 1 TD, while J. Brahms caught 5 passes for 41 yards and 2 TDs. This is what "pro-life football" looks like, apparently.
            </div>

            <div class="stat-highlight">
                <strong>Tennessee's Collapse:</strong> Despite Deuce Knight's impressive 248 passing yards and 4 TDs, the Vols' defense simply couldn't contain Wyoming's newly ideologically-aligned offense. Knight's long pass was 75 yards, but it wasn't enough to overcome Kirk's "patriotic" game plan.
            </div>

            <p>Kirk's comments have sparked immediate backlash from athletic directors across the country, with one anonymous SEC official saying: "We have no idea what he's talking about. You can't recruit based on political ideology. This is insane." But Kirk remained unmoved, insisting that "conservative players are more disciplined, more focused on traditional values, and less likely to be distracted by woke nonsense."</p>

            <p>The win puts Wyoming at 3-0 and has Kirk eyeing a potential bowl game—something many thought impossible given Wyoming's historical struggles. When pressed on whether this strategy is sustainable, Kirk simply replied: "We're going to keep recruiting patriots and gerrymandering out the libs. It's working, isn't it?"</p>

                <h3>The Post-Game Q&A: Kirk's "Conservative" Revelations</h3>
                
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Coach, you mentioned "gerrymandering out the snowflake libs." Isn't that... a little extreme?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Extreme? EXTREME?! You know what's extreme? Having liberals on your football team! These kids don't know discipline. They're too busy protesting and checking their pronouns to learn the option play. My conservative players run WITH PURPOSE. They block for the LORD, not for social justice. That's the difference. Next question."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: How do you even determine a player's political beliefs during recruitment?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Simple. We ask them straight up: 'Do you support traditional values? Do you love America? Do you believe life begins at conception?' If they hesitate or start talking about 'nuance,' they're OUT. We've got a screening process. It's beautiful, really. We're the only program doing this, and guess what? We're undefeated. Coincidence? I think NOT."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Deuce Knight had an incredible game with 4 TDs. Isn't he... from Tennessee, a liberal state?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Knight's a pure runner. He doesn't think, he just executes. That's conservative. He doesn't question authority, he doesn't talk back, he runs the play. THAT'S conservative football. Tennessee can keep their purple-haired hippie quarterbacks—we're winning with PATRIOTS."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Some say this approach might violate NCAA recruiting rules?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"The NCAA can go to Hell. You can't tell me I can't recruit based on values. VALUES ARE EVERYTHING. I'm not breaking any rules—I'm just asking players about their BELIEFS. If they believe in freedom, they can play for Wyoming. If they believe in socialism, they can go to Boulder or Berkeley or wherever the libs hang out. This is FREE MARKET CAPITALISM applied to football."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: What about your backup QBs? Blake Barnett seems to be thriving under this system.</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Blake is PATRIOTIC. He wears a hat that says 'Make America Great Again' to practice. He doesn't complain about playing time, he just works. He doesn't tweet about social issues, he tweets about JESUS. THAT'S the difference. Kaden Anderson? Kaden got lost somewhere between the durag phase and the yarmulke phase—just kidding, I'm talking about Kirk 2.0. Point is: Blake BELIEVES in what we're doing here at Wyoming."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: You're 3-0. How long can you maintain this winning streak with this approach?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"As long as we keep playing CONSERVATIVE football. We've got three more weeks before we face Colorado State and Thad Castle, who's probably smoking crack in his office right now. Thad's got a good team, but he's a DEGENERATE. We're the moral team. We're the RIGHTEOUS team. God is on our side, and God likes WINNING. Mark my words: Wyoming is going to the College Football Playoff if we keep this conservative philosophy going. The snowflakes can't stop us."</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Wyoming's next game is against Colorado State in two weeks. Thad Castle, when informed of Kirk's recruiting philosophy, reportedly responded: "That motherf***er is completely INSANE. We're going to beat Wyoming by 50 and then beat his ass in the press conference after. Conservative football? The only thing conservative about Kirk is his IQ—it's FIXED at zero."</p>
