        <div class="article-body">
            <p>FORT COLLINS, Colo. — Colorado State has named Mrs. Frank as the program's new head football coach, marking yet another unconventional hire in what has become a wild offseason across college football. Frank takes over a Rams program that finished 3-9 in 2024-25 under former head coach Jay Norvell, who was dismissed following the season.</p>

            <p>The Rams struggled mightily last season, failing to find consistency on either side of the ball. The offense ranked near the bottom of the Mountain West in several categories, while the defense surrendered over 30 points per game. Colorado State also lost key players to the transfer portal, including several starters who departed for Power Four programs seeking more competitive opportunities.</p>

            <p>Frank arrives with a mandate to rebuild the program from the ground up. At her introductory press conference, she emphasized the importance of player development and creating a winning culture. "This program has all the pieces to be successful," Frank stated. "Great facilities, passionate fans, and a conference where we can compete immediately. My job is to get the right players in here and put them in positions to succeed."</p>

            <p>The hire has generated curiosity throughout the college football landscape, with many wondering if Frank can translate her vision into victories on the field. With the season opener looming, Colorado State faithful will soon discover whether this gamble pays off. The Rams open against UNLV in what will be a crucial early test for the new coaching staff.</p>
