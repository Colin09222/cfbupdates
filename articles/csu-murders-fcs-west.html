        <img src="../images/CSUCOACH.jpg" alt="Coach Thad Castle" class="article-image">
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Absolute carnage in Fort Collins. Colorado State, under the iron fist of head coach Thad Castle, put together one of the most dominant performances of the young season, obliterating FCS West 56-17 in a game that was over before halftime. The Rams showed no mercy, and frankly, FCS West should probably just be grateful they made it out of Canvas Stadium alive.</p>
            <p>Quarterback Jackson Brousseau was absolutely surgical, completing 27 of 33 passes for 316 yards and 5 touchdowns with just 1 interception. That's an 81% completion rate for those of you keeping score at home. Brousseau carved up the overmatched FCS West secondary like it personally offended him.</p>
            <div class="score-box">
                <h3>Final Score</h3>
                <p><strong>Colorado State: 56</strong></p>
                <p>FCS West: 17</p>
                <p>CSU Passing: Brousseau 27/33, 316 yards, 5 TD, 1 INT</p>
                <p>CSU Rushing: Dupree 25-164-1 TD, Avant 7-98-2 TD</p>
                <p>Total Offense: 568 yards</p>
                <p>CSU First Downs: 32 | FCS West First Downs: 17</p>
            </div>
            <p>The ground game was equally devastating. Jalen Dupree carried the rock 25 times for 164 yards and a score, while L. Avant added 7 carries for 98 yards and 2 touchdowns. When you can throw for 316 and run for 252 in the same game, there's not much the opposing defense can do except pray for halftime.</p>
            <p>Coach Thad Castle has this team playing with an aggression that borders on illegal. The Rams are now 2-1 on the season and look like they could make serious noise in the Mountain West.</p>

                <h3>🎤 Postgame Interview - QB Jackson Brousseau</h3>
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="question">Q: Jackson, that was an incredible performance out there. 5 touchdowns. How did you see the field so well today?</p>
                    <p class="answer">"Bro... *long pause* ...what? Oh, yeah, the game. Man, the field was like... really green today, you know? Like... really, really green. I was just out there vibing, throwing the ball to the guys who looked most open. Or maybe they were just the guys closest to me. I don't really remember honestly."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="question">Q: You completed 81% of your passes. Was there something in the gameplan that had you feeling confident?</p>
                    <p class="answer">"Gameplan? *giggles* Bro I just woke up like an hour before kickoff. Coach Castle was yelling something about murder and I was like 'bet' and then I came out here and threw touchdowns. Did we win? We won right? *looks around confused* Why is it so bright in here?"</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="question">Q: What was working so well with your receivers today, particularly in the red zone?</p>
                    <p class="answer">"The red zone is crazy because it's like... not even red, you know? It's like the same grass as everywhere else. Who decided to call it that? *stares at ceiling* Anyway, I just throw the ball high and let my guys go get it. They're tall. I'm tall. Everyone's tall in this building right now. Is anyone else hungry? I could really go for some pizza."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="question">Q: Any message for next week's opponent?</p>
                    <p class="answer">"Yeah... *extremely long pause* ...wait who do we play next week? Actually, it doesn't matter. Just tell them Coach Castle is coming, and Coach Castle doesn't play. None of us play. Well, we do play. Football. That's what we play. *laughs at nothing* I gotta go, I think I left my car running. Do I have a car? Peace."</p>
