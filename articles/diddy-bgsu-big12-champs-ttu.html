        <h1 class="article-title">BGSU WINS BIG 12 CHAMPIONSHIP: Defensive Masterclass Holds #7 Texas Tech to 244 Yards, 28-24</h1>
        
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Bowling Green football is BACK ON TOP of the Big 12. In a dominant defensive performance at the Big 12 Championship game, the Falcons absolutely suffocated #7 Texas Tech, holding the Red Raiders to just 244 total yards in a 28-24 championship victory.</p>

            <p>This wasn't a shootout. This wasn't a track meet. This was a defensive statement. BGSU took one of the nation's top-7 teams and forced them into complete offensive impotence, proving that the Bad Boy era of Bowling Green football isn't over—it's just evolved.</p>

            <div class="score-box">
                <h3>FINAL SCORE: BGSU 28, Texas Tech 24</h3>
                <p><strong>BGSU Offensive Stats:</strong></p>
                <p>354 total yards (261 passing, 93 rushing)</p>
                <p>22/30 passing (73%), 4 TDs, 1 INT</p>
                <p>53 total plays</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Texas Tech's Collapse:</strong></p>
                <p>244 total yards (190 passing, 54 rushing)</p>
                <p>36 total plays, 6.8 yards per play</p>
                <p>M. Hawkins Jr.: 15/19 (78%), 190 yards, 3 TDs, 0 INTs—but it didn't matter</p>
            </div>

            <p>J. Kush had another solid performance under center, completing 22 of 30 passes for 235 yards and 4 touchdowns with just 1 interception. J. Earl led the receiving corps with 7 catches for 89 yards and a touchdown. B. Friend added 4 receptions for 40 yards and 2 TDs. The offense was efficient, methodical, and relentless.</p>

            <p>But the real story? The DEFENSE. BGSU's defense put a CLAMP on one of the best offensive teams in college football.</p>

            <div class="defense-section">
                <h3>The Defensive Masterclass</h3>
                
                <div class="defense-item">
                    <p><span class="defense-stat">244 Total Yards Allowed:</span> Texas Tech came into this game as a top-7 offensive power. BGSU held them to fewer than 250 yards. That's not just good—that's ELITE. That's championship-level defense.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="defense-item">
                    <p><span class="defense-stat">G. Godfrey (4 solo tackles):</span> Leading the charge for the Falcons' defense, Godfrey was all over the field, disrupting TTU's rhythm at every turn. When Texas Tech tried to establish anything, Godfrey was there to shut it down.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="defense-item">
                    <p><span class="defense-stat">V. Swain (4 solo, 1 assist):</span> Swain was relentless in his pursuit, setting the tone for a defense that refused to let Texas Tech's talent shine through. Multiple pressures, multiple disruptions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="defense-item">
                    <p><span class="defense-stat">Texas Tech's Running Game Neutered:</span> With just 54 rushing yards on 17 attempts (3.2 yards per carry), O. Joyner and the Red Raiders couldn't establish any ground game. BGSU's front four was UNBLOCKABLE.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="defense-item">
                    <p><span class="defense-stat">3rd Down Conversion Rate:</span> BGSU forced Texas Tech into an absolutely miserable 3-for-6 (50%) on third downs. When you can't convert third downs, you can't move the ball. When you can't move the ball, you can't win championships. It's that simple.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>This is a far cry from the national championship game loss to Colorado State just weeks ago. That game exposed some defensive vulnerabilities. BGSU took that loss, learned from it, and came back to put on a MASTERCLASS of defensive football.</p>

            <p>"We came into this game knowing Texas Tech was a top-7 offense," Diddy told reporters after the game, visibly emotional. "We knew their quarterback was playing lights out. But our defense said 'NO.' Our defense said 'NOT TODAY.' This is Big 12 Championship defense. This is CHAMPIONSHIP-LEVEL defense. I'm proud of every single one of those guys."</p>

            <div class="stat-highlight">
                <strong>The Bottom Line:</strong> Bowling Green didn't just beat Texas Tech. They dominated them. They held one of the nation's elite offenses to 244 yards and forced them into critical third-down situations all game long. This is the kind of performance that wins championships. This is the kind of defense that makes you believe Bowling Green can compete for a national title next season.
            </div>

            <p>With the Big 12 Championship now in hand, BGSU will head into the College Football Playoff as a legitimate threat. They've proven they can play elite defense. They've proven they can move the ball consistently on offense. And they've proven that the Bad Boy era of Bowling Green football is far from over.</p>

            <p>Colorado State's Thad Castle, when asked about BGSU's Big 12 Championship win, responded: "Good for them. But we're still the national champions. BGSU can talk all they want, but we won it all. Now if they want to come find us in the playoff, we'll be ready. Bring it on, bitches!"</p>

            <p>Wyoming's Charlie Kirk was unavailable for comment, reportedly busy recruiting conservative players and "oiling himself up for a lawsuit against the NCAA."</p>

            <p>Bowling Green's Big 12 Championship is official. The dynasty continues.</p>
