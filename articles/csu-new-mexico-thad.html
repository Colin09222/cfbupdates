        <div class="article-content">
            <p>FORT COLLINS, CO — Colorado State improved to 4-0 on the season with a convincing 49-26 victory over New Mexico on Saturday afternoon. The Rams looked every bit like a Mountain West contender, dominating on both sides of the ball in front of a raucous home crowd. Head coach Thad Castle, who was visibly... celebratory... throughout the game, called it "the most beautiful thing I've ever seen, and I've seen some beautiful things, man."</p>
            
            <p>Quarterback Jackson Brousseau continued his stellar season, completing 24 of 36 passes for 429 yards and 6 touchdowns with just 2 interceptions. Brousseau's command of the offense was surgical, spreading the ball to multiple receivers with Kojo Antwi leading the way with 13 receptions for 130 yards and a touchdown. Tory Maher added 3 catches for 89 yards and 2 scores, while L. Avant contributed 3 receptions for 76 yards. The Rams racked up 533 yards of total offense compared to New Mexico's 338.</p>
            
            <div class="score-box">
                <h3>Final Score</h3>
                <p><strong>Colorado State: 49</strong></p>
                <p>New Mexico: 26</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9rem;">CSU - J. Brousseau: 24/36, 429 YDS, 6 TD, 2 INT</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">CSU - K. Antwi: 13 REC, 130 YDS, 1 TD</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">CSU - T. Maher: 3 REC, 89 YDS, 2 TD</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">CSU - Rushing: 17 CAR, 104 YDS, 1 TD</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The ground game was efficient as well, with the Rams rushing for 104 yards on just 17 carries including a touchdown. Colorado State dominated time of possession and converted 6 of 7 third downs, keeping the New Mexico defense on the field for extended periods. The Lobos simply had no answer for CSU's multi-faceted attack, and by the fourth quarter, the game was well out of reach.</p>
            
            <p>With the win, Colorado State sits atop the Mountain West standings and has legitimate aspirations for a conference championship run. The Rams' offense is averaging over 45 points per game, and Brousseau is emerging as a dark horse Heisman candidate. Coach Castle, meanwhile, celebrated the victory by cracking open what appeared to be his fourth beer of the second half, telling reporters he was "just staying hydrated."</p>

                <p style="color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">(Note: Coach Castle appeared at the podium approximately 20 minutes late, holding a beverage and speaking slowly)</p>

                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Coach, great win today. Your thoughts on the performance?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Bro... bro. Did you SEE that? Jackson was out there just... *makes throwing motion and stares at his hand for five seconds* ...slinging it, dude. Like a wizard. A football wizard. I love that guy. I love all my guys. I love you. This is beautiful."</p>

                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Brousseau threw for over 400 yards. Is he the best QB in the Mountain West?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Best? BEST? He's the best quarterback in the UNIVERSE, man. You ever think about how the ball is like... spiral shaped? And it just... *spirals hand in the air* ...goes through the air like that? That's physics. Jackson understands physics on a molecular level. I don't even think he's human sometimes. In a good way."</p>

                    <p class="qa-answer">"*takes a long sip* Okay, okay, I'll tell you. But you can't tell anyone. *leans into microphone* We practice. *leans back and laughs for 15 seconds* Nah but for real, these kids work hard. And I reward hard work. With wins. And sometimes snacks. Everyone deserves snacks."</p>

                    <p class="qa-answer">"Ceiling? There is no ceiling, my guy. We're going to the... what's it called... the ceiling above the ceiling. The roof. No wait, we're going through the roof. To the sky. Sky's the limit but also the sky isn't real, it's just... atmosphere and stuff. We're going to the atmosphere."</p>

                    <p class="qa-answer">"*stares blankly for 8 seconds* What interceptions? Oh those? Nah man, those were just... Jackson was being generous. Sharing the ball with the other team. He's a kind soul. Can't be mad at kindness. That's what's wrong with the world, people getting mad at kindness."</p>

                    <p class="qa-answer">"This? *looks at can* This is a recovery beverage. Hydration is key. Electrolytes. Barley has electrolytes. I'm just trying to be healthy, man. You should try it. Actually wait, are you old enough? I'm not giving you one if you're not old enough. I'm responsible."</p>
