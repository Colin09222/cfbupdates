            <p>BOWLING GREEN, OH — In a shocking turn of events just 72 hours before Bowling Green's Big 12 Conference Championship matchup against TCU, head coach Sean "Diddy" Combs was admitted to Wood County Hospital Thursday evening with what medical professionals are calling "an exceptionally rare and aggressive sexually transmitted infection." According to hospital spokesperson Dr. Margaret Chen, Combs contracted the disease at what he described to nurses as "one of my legendary Diddy parties" last weekend. The infection is so uncommon that the CDC has been notified and is sending infectious disease specialists to Ohio for observation. Combs remains in stable condition but is ruled out for Saturday's championship game. Assistant coach Derek Van Der Merwe will assume head coaching duties.</p>

            <p>"I gave him all the love, ALL the love," Combs reportedly told medical staff while being wheeled into the hospital, before clarifying that his statement was "purely metaphorical and not admissible in court." The Bowling Green offense, which relies heavily on Combs' hands-on coaching methods and controversial "massage-based" route running drills, scrambled Friday to adjust game plans without their leader. Star tight end Arlis Boardingham, who has been the subject of Combs' intense personal development program, expressed concern: "Coach Diddy always said he'd 'touch our lives,' but I didn't think it would be literal like this. We're gonna miss him out there." The Big 12 Championship is TCU's to lose, with Bowling Green now operating at a significant disadvantage heading into Saturday's 8 PM kickoff.</p>

                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Coach Combs, how are you feeling?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"I'm blessed, I'm alive, I'm in God's hands now. The doctors say I got something they ain't never seen before. They said it's so rare, it might be named after me. Bad Boy Syndrome or something. I ain't mad about that, that's legacy right there."</p>

                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Can you describe how you contracted this infection?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Man, it was a party, you know? A real Bad Boy party. Everyone was there, the vibes were RIGHT, we were celebrating Arlis's Heisman campaign... I don't even know how it happened, bro. One minute I'm getting a massage, next minute I got a disease the CDC don't know about. That's entertainment though."</p>

                    <p class="qa-answer">"Nah man, I can't be out there. The doctors said if I exert myself I might spread it to the turf. Can you imagine? 'Bowling Green field contaminated with Diddy disease' - that ain't the legacy I want. I'ma watch from my hospital bed and pray. Arlis better go OFF."</p>
