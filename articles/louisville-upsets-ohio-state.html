            <p>Columbus is in full meltdown mode. The #17 Ohio State Buckeyes dropped to 1-2 on the season after falling to the #21 Louisville Cardinals 31-28 in what can only be described as a complete embarrassment for a program that entered the season with national championship aspirations. The loss marks Ohio State's second consecutive defeat, and the vultures are already circling around the coaching staff.</p>
            <p>Louisville came into the Horseshoe with something to prove, and they proved it in front of 105,000 stunned fans in scarlet and gray. The Cardinals, now 3-0 on the young season, played with a chip on their shoulder all game long, refusing to be intimidated by the hostile environment.</p>
            <div class="score-box">
                <h3>Final Score</h3>
                <p><strong>#21 Louisville: 31</strong></p>
                <p>#17 Ohio State: 28</p>
                <p>Records: Louisville (3-0) | Ohio State (1-2)</p>
            </div>
            <p>The Buckeyes' issues are glaring at this point. After a promising Week 0, Ohio State has now lost two straight games and looks nothing like the team that was supposed to contend for a Big Ten title. The offensive line has been getting pushed around, the secondary is getting exposed, and the playcalling has been questionable at best.</p>
            <p>For Louisville, this win is a statement. Head coach Jeff Brohm has his squad playing with supreme confidence. Meanwhile, Ohio State has to figure out what went wrong and fast. At 1-2, every game from here on out is essentially a must-win. Welcome to rock bottom, Buckeye Nation.</p>
