        <img src="../images/wyomingcoach_week9.jpg" alt="Coach Charlie Kirk Press Conference" class="article-image">
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>LARAMIE, WY — Wyoming head coach Charlie Kirk couldn't just enjoy a dominant 42-27 victory over Air Force on Saturday. Instead, the controversial coach used his postgame press conference to launch into yet another unhinged tirade, this time questioning the qualifications of minority pilots in the United States Air Force. The comments have already sparked outrage across social media and drawn condemnation from the Air Force Academy.</p>
            
            <p>On the field, the Cowboys were dominant. Quarterback Kaden Anderson was surgical, completing 21 of 29 passes for 337 yards and 6 touchdowns with zero interceptions. Wyoming racked up 427 yards of total offense compared to Air Force's 373, and the Cowboys controlled the clock throughout. Running back Terron Kellman added 90 yards on 15 carries, and tight end John Gyllenborg hauled in 11 receptions for 148 yards and 3 touchdowns. It was a complete performance that moved Wyoming to 5-2 on the season.</p>
            
            <div class="score-box">
                <h3>Final Score</h3>
                <p><strong>Wyoming: 42</strong></p>
                <p>Air Force: 27</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9rem;">WYO - K. Anderson: 21/29, 337 YDS, 6 TD, 0 INT</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">WYO - J. Gyllenborg: 11 REC, 148 YDS, 3 TD</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">WYO - T. Kellman: 15 CAR, 90 YDS</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>But Kirk seemed more interested in discussing the Air Force's diversity initiatives than his team's performance. When asked about facing the triple option, Kirk pivoted immediately to his concerns about military readiness. "Look, we beat Air Force today, great. But let me tell you something about the REAL Air Force," Kirk began, as reporters exchanged nervous glances. "All I'm saying is if I see a Black pilot, my first thought is 'boy, I hope he's qualified.' That's not racist, that's just being realistic about DEI hiring practices. Are they hiring the best pilots or are they meeting quotas? I'm just asking questions."</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                "When I get on a plane, I want to know the pilot got there on merit. Not because some bureaucrat in Washington said we need more diversity in the cockpit. This is life and death stuff. Football is life and death stuff too, that's why I only recruit based on ability." — Coach Charlie Kirk
            </div>
            
            <p>Kirk continued his rant for nearly ten minutes, touching on everything from "woke generals" to his belief that "the Chinese are laughing at us while we're worried about pronouns in the barracks." Air Force Academy officials released a statement within hours condemning Kirk's remarks as "ignorant, offensive, and fundamentally misunderstanding the rigorous standards all Air Force pilots must meet regardless of background." Wyoming Athletic Director Tom Burman has not yet commented on whether any disciplinary action will be taken. The Cowboys face Colorado State next week in what promises to be a heated rivalry matchup.</p>
