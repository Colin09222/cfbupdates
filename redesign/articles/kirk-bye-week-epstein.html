        <h1 class="article-title">Bye Week Blues: Coach Charlie Kirk Mourns Anniversary of Friend and Donor Jeffrey Epstein</h1>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Laramie is quiet this week. With Wyoming on a bye, head coach Charlie Kirk has had time to reflect — and that reflection has led him to a somber place. This week marks another anniversary of the passing of his dear friend and longtime program benefactor, Jeffrey Epstein. Kirk spoke exclusively with CFB Updates about the profound impact Epstein had on building Wyoming football into what it is today.</p>
            <p>"Jeffrey believed in this program when nobody else did," Kirk said during an emotional press availability Tuesday. "He saw the potential in Wyoming football, and more importantly, he saw the potential in young men. He was always talking about the youth, about investing in their futures. Some people say he was too involved with young people, but that's just because they didn't understand his passion for mentorship."</p>
            <div class="quote-box">
                "I still text him sometimes. I know people say he's gone, but I don't believe it. A man like Jeffrey doesn't just disappear. He's out there somewhere, probably on an island, doing what he loved — helping young people reach their potential."

            <p>Kirk also used the bye week press conference to address what he calls "the DEI problem" in college football recruiting. The Wyoming head coach was characteristically blunt when asked about the team's recruiting strategy going forward. "I've made it clear to our administration — we will NOT be recruiting these so-called 'highly rated' DEI recruits who are only getting stars because of the woke mob," Kirk stated firmly. "Some of these kids have four and five stars next to their name, and you look at the tape and wonder who they paid off. We're building a program based on merit, not this progressive nonsense that's ruining the sport."</p>
            <p>The Cowboys sit at 2-1 heading into the back half of their schedule, and Kirk believes the team is poised for a special season — one he wishes Epstein could be here to see. "Jeffrey would have loved this team," Kirk said, staring wistfully out the window of his office. "The camaraderie, the brotherhood, the young men dedicating themselves to something bigger than themselves. That's what he was all about. Anyway, we've got a big game coming up after the bye, and we're going to honor Jeffrey's memory by playing Wyoming football. Physical, disciplined, and merit-based. The way it should be."</p>
