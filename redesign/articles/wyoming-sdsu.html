        <div class="article-content">
            <p>The Charlie Kirk era at Wyoming is officially underway with a win. The Cowboys defeated San Diego State 27-16 in Kirk's debut as a college head coach, showing a physical brand of football that Kirk promised during his introductory press conference.</p>
            <p>Wyoming's defense set the tone early, limiting the Aztecs' rushing attack and forcing several key turnovers. The offense, while not flashy, was efficient and controlled the clock effectively.</p>
            <div class="score-box">
                <h3>Final Score</h3>
                <p><strong>Wyoming: 27</strong></p>
                <p>San Diego State: 16</p>
            </div>
            <p>Kirk, who came to Wyoming with a vision of building a tough, disciplined program, saw his players execute that vision from the opening kickoff. The Cowboys won the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball and never let SDSU gain momentum.</p>

                <p class="question">Q: Coach Kirk, how does it feel to get your first win as a college head coach?</p>
                <p class="answer">"This is what we came here to do. We're building something special in Laramie. These young men bought into the system, they played physical, they played smart. That's Wyoming football."</p>

            <div class="qa-item">
                <p class="question">Q: What was the key to the defensive performance today?</p>
                <p class="answer">"Discipline. We don't do the progressive offense stuff here. We line up, we hit you in the mouth, and we do it again. Simple, traditional football. That's what wins games."</p>
