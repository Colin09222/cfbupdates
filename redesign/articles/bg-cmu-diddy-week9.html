            <p>BOWLING GREEN, OH — Bowling Green secured a crucial 35-21 victory over Central Michigan on Saturday, but head coach Sean "Diddy" Combs made headlines for entirely different reasons during his postgame press conference. When asked about his team's physical preparation for the game, Combs launched into an extended explanation of his hands-on approach to player wellness that left reporters shifting uncomfortably in their seats.</p>
            
            <p>The Falcons were led by quarterback Drew Pyne, who completed 31 of 41 passes for 217 yards and 3 touchdowns with just 1 interception. Star tight end Arlis Boardingham continued his monster season with 13 receptions for 92 yards and a touchdown. The running game was equally effective, with 154 yards on 20 carries and a touchdown. Bowling Green out-gained Central Michigan 371-194 in total offense and controlled the game from start to finish.</p>

                <p><strong>Bowling Green: 35</strong></p>

            <p>"I need to touch the players," Combs explained when asked about his pregame routine. "Before every game, I go around the locker room and I put my hands on every single player. Shoulders, backs, necks... you gotta feel the tension in their muscles, you know? I give them massages. Deep tissue. That's how you build trust. That's how you build a family. Some coaches just yell from the sideline. I believe in the power of physical connection with my athletes."</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                "The massage is essential. I learned this from my time in the music industry. You want peak performance? You gotta work out those knots. I spend at least an hour before every game in the locker room, hands on bodies, making sure my boys are loose and ready. It's intimate, yes, but that's what separates us from other programs." — Coach Sean "Diddy" Combs
            </div>
            
            <p>Combs went on to describe how he's implemented mandatory "recovery sessions" where he personally oversees stretching and massage therapy for players in his office. "Sometimes they're sore after practice, so they come to my office, we dim the lights, put on some music, and I work on them," Combs said, seemingly unaware of how his comments might be perceived. "The door's closed obviously, for privacy. These are private moments between a coach and his players. That's how we got to 4-4 this season. That's how Boardingham became a first-round pick prospect. Through my hands." University officials have not commented on Combs' training methods.</p>
