        <h1 class="article-title">"Riding High" - #17 Colorado State Survives Utah State Shootout 56-49 After Dominant Win Over Wyoming</h1>
        <img src="../images/castle_week11.jpg" alt="Coach Thad Castle with player" class="article-image">
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>FORT COLLINS, CO — In what can only be described as the highest-scoring game in recent Mountain West history, #17 Colorado State outlasted Utah State 56-49 in a wild shootout Saturday afternoon. The Rams, coming off a dominant 35-14 victory over rival Wyoming last week, appeared to be operating on a different plane of existence — and head coach Thad Castle's postgame press conference confirmed what many suspected: the entire team was absolutely blazed.</p>
            
            <p>Quarterback Jackson Brousseau continued his Heisman-caliber campaign, completing 40 of 47 passes for a staggering 666 yards and 6 touchdowns with 3 interceptions. The Rams racked up 679 total yards of offense compared to Utah State's 407, averaging an absurd 13.1 yards per play. CSU's passing attack was virtually unstoppable, with Brousseau connecting on 85% of his throws and recording a long pass of 80 yards. The ground game added 13 yards on 5 carries with 2 rushing touchdowns.</p>
            
            <div class="score-box">
                <h3>Final Score</h3>
                <p><strong>#17 Colorado State: 56</strong></p>
                <p>Utah State: 49</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9rem;">CSU - J. Brousseau: 40/47, 666 YDS, 6 TD, 3 INT</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">CSU Total Offense: 679 yards (13.1 YPP)</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">CSU Rushing: 5-13-2 (5 carries, 13 yards, 2 TD)</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The victory moves Colorado State to 9-1 on the season, firmly in the College Football Playoff conversation. But when Castle finally appeared at the podium — 25 minutes late and wearing sunglasses indoors — it became immediately clear that something was off. His eyes were bloodshot behind the shades, he kept giggling at nothing, and at one point asked a reporter if they "had any Funyuns." The entire coaching staff seated behind him appeared similarly affected, with offensive coordinator visibly struggling to keep his eyes open.</p>
            
            <p>When asked about the team's preparation leading up to the game, Castle launched into a rambling, barely coherent explanation that shed light on why a 9-1 team nearly lost to 4-6 Utah State. The Rams led 21-0 at one point before the Aggies stormed back, and Castle's candid admission about his team's extracurricular activities explains the second-half collapse. Athletic director Joe Parker has scheduled a meeting with Castle for Monday morning.</p>

                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Coach, walk us through the game plan today.</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">*giggles for 10 seconds* "Bro... the game plan was... *long pause* ...what was the question? Oh yeah, the plan was to like, throw the ball. A lot. And we did. Brousseau was feeling it today. We were ALL feeling it, you know what I mean? *winks repeatedly*"</p>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: You were up 21-0 and let Utah State back in. What happened?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Yeah so... *takes off sunglasses, reveals extremely red eyes, puts them back on* ...okay so here's the thing. We got super high before the game. Like, the WHOLE team. Equipment managers, trainers, the bus driver, everybody. And it was GREAT for the first half. We were locked in, bro. Everything was moving in slow motion, we could see the plays developing... but then halftime hit and we all just wanted to eat pizza and take a nap. The munchies are undefeated."</p>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Can you speak to Brousseau's performance? 666 yards is remarkable.</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"666... *laughs uncontrollably* ...that's the devil's number, bro. Jackson is literally possessed. Did you see his eyes out there? Redder than mine. He told me at halftime he could see sounds. I was like, 'same bro, same.' But seriously, kid's a gamer. Gonna be a first-round pick. Just hope they don't drug test him tomorrow. *entire coaching staff laughs nervously*"</p>

                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Last week you dominated Wyoming 35-14. How did that feel?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Oh man, the Wyoming game... *stares into space for 15 seconds* ...yeah gonna be honest, we fell off in the second half of that one too because the blow wore off. Gonna have to find a new dealer. The stuff we had was weak. First half we were FLYING, defense was moving at like 2x speed. Second half, everyone was crashing. Kirk probably thought he was making adjustments but nah, we were just coming down. My bad."</p>

                    <p class="qa-question">Q: What's your message to the team heading into the final stretch?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"We need to pace ourselves better. With the drugs, I mean. And hydration. Very important to stay hydrated when you're... *trails off, stares at ceiling* ...what were we talking about? Oh yeah, playoffs. We're going to the playoffs. Unless they test us. Then maybe not. *nervous laughter*"</p>

                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Coach, are you saying your team uses performance-enhancing substances?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Performance-enhancing? Bro, have you seen us play defense? Those aren't enhancing anything except our appetite. We're talking recreational here. Team bonding. Nothing brings a locker room together like a shared... experience. *looks around paranoid* This isn't being recorded, right? Wait, those are cameras. *waves* Hi mom."</p>

                    <p class="qa-answer">"I love this team. I love this school. I love... *gets distracted by a light on the ceiling* ...whoa, that light is beautiful. Is anyone else seeing this? Anyway, we're 9-1, Brousseau is the best QB in the country, and we're about to smoke... I mean BEAT... everyone in our path. Ram pride, baby. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date with a family-size bag of Doritos. *stands up, knocks over microphone, stumbles out*"</p>
