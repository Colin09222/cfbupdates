        <img src="../images/thad-castle-allegations.jpg" alt="Thad Castle Press Conference" class="featured-img">
        
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>In a shocking development that has rocked the college football world, Colorado State head coach Thad Castle has been implicated in the newly released Epstein files. Castle held an emergency press conference this morning, visibly sweating and speaking incoherently, to deny any involvement in what he called "the witch hunt against America's greatest football mind."</p>

            <div class="breaking-box">
                <h3>THE ALLEGATIONS</h3>
                <p>According to documents released by federal authorities, Thad Castle's name appears 47 times in the Epstein files, mostly in connection with travel records and mysterious invoices labeled "HALF BACK TOSS consulting." Castle vehemently denied the allegations, claiming the documents were "FAKE NEWS" and "part of a conspiracy by Diddy and Wyoming to take down Colorado State."</p>
            </div>

            <p>At the press conference, Castle appeared disheveled, tie askew, speaking rapidly and occasionally slurring his words (which insiders claim is his normal state, but seemed WORSE than usual today).</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <strong>"Listen to me,"</strong> Castle began, gesturing wildly at cameras. <strong>"I don't know NOTHING about no Epstein files. I've never been to any islands. I don't know Jeffrey Epstein. The only thing I'm guilty of is being TOO GOOD at football. The only 'offense' I've committed is OFFENSE ON THE FIELD! HALF BACK TOSS! That's what they're scared of—my GENIUS play-calling!"</strong>
            </div>

            <p>When pressed by reporters about specific documents mentioning his name, Castle became more agitated:</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <strong>"Those aren't MY documents! Those are DEEPFAKES! They're using AI to put my name in there! Diddy's probably behind this! He's in PRISON and he's STILL trying to take me down! Well guess what? Colorado State is the NATIONAL CHAMPION and I'M the greatest coach in America! You can't take that away from me with your FAKE FILES!"</strong>
            </div>

            <p>Castle then claimed that the Epstein files were actually about a different person named "Thad" and that it was all a "massive coincidence." When asked to provide his alibi for the dates mentioned in the documents, Castle responded:</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <strong>"My alibi? I was in Colorado, coaching FOOTBALL! I was HIGH! I was watching game film! I was eating cocaine— I MEAN, I WAS NOT EATING COCAINE! I was coaching! That's what I was doing! COACHING! Nothing else!"</strong>
            </div>

            <p>Legal experts are divided on what these revelations mean for Castle's future in college football. NCAA spokesperson released a statement saying: "We are aware of the allegations against Coach Castle and are conducting an investigation. However, we note that at this time, no charges have been filed and Coach Castle denies all claims."</p>

            <p>Diddy, responding from federal prison, had this to say via his lawyer:</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <strong>"Thad Castle in the Epstein files? That's HILARIOUS! The man's a DEGENERATE! I KNEW IT! I KNEW SOMETHING WAS OFF ABOUT THAT MOTHERF***ER! And before y'all ask, NO, I didn't have anything to do with this leak. The universe is just exposing FRAUDS! Thad Castle is about to GO DOWN! BGSU is coming for that national title!"</strong>
            </div>

            <p>Wyoming's Charlie Kirk released a statement claiming: "This proves that there's a LIBERAL DEEP STATE conspiracy to target CONSERVATIVE coaches like myself while letting DEGENERATE coaches like Thad Castle get away with things for YEARS. This is political persecution of patriots!"</p>

            <p>Castle concluded his press conference by threatening to sue "everyone involved in this conspiracy," including "the Epstein estate, the FBI, Diddy, Charlie Kirk, the NCAA, Twitter, the media, and possibly the sun for shining on my enemies."</p>

            <p>Colorado State's athletic department released a brief statement: "Coach Castle remains on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. We are committed to maintaining the integrity of our program."</p>

            <p>As of press time, Thad Castle had tweeted (then deleted) 37 different conspiracy theories about the Epstein files, called for a "complete audit of the federal government," and claimed that the documents were created using "AI that was invented by the Clinton Foundation."</p>

            <p>The national championship game is in two weeks. All eyes remain on Colorado State and whether Thad Castle will be able to coach during the playoff run.</p>
