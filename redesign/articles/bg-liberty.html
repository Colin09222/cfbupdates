        <div class="article-content">
            <p>The Sean "Diddy" Combs era at Bowling Green started with a bang. The Falcons dominated Liberty 34-17, with quarterback Drew Pyne putting on an absolute clinic, tossing 5 touchdown passes in Coach Combs' debut.</p>
            <p>Pyne was surgical all game, finding open receivers and making smart decisions with the football. The offense looked dynamic under Combs' new system, and the defense did enough to keep Liberty's attack at bay.</p>
            <div class="score-box">
                <h3>Final Score</h3>
                <p><strong>Bowling Green: 34</strong></p>
                <p>Liberty: 17</p>
                <p>Drew Pyne: 5 TD passes</p>
            </div>
            <p>For Jamey Chadwell and Liberty, this was a disappointing start. The Flames couldn't get anything going consistently and were outplayed in all three phases.</p>
