        <h1 class="article-title">Dynasty in Ruins: Diddy & Arlis Boardingham Arrested on Drug Charges</h1>
        
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>In a stunning development that has sent shockwaves through the college football world, Sean "Diddy" Combs and star tight end Arlis Boardingham were arrested early this morning on federal drug possession charges. Sources close to the Bowling Green program indicate that the two have been missing since the arrests, with both facing potential prison time that could derail Boardingham's NFL Draft prospects entirely.</p>

            <p>The arrest came after a DEA raid on the Bowling Green athletic facilities uncovered what authorities described as "substantial quantities" of controlled substances in the coaching offices. Diddy, who has been the face of the Falcons program for years, was taken into custody without incident. Boardingham, considered the nation's top tight end prospect, was apprehended at his residence in Toledo.</p>

            <div class="score-box">
                <h3>The Charges</h3>
                <p><strong>Diddy Combs:</strong> Federal drug possession, distribution, conspiracy</p>
                <p><strong>Arlis Boardingham:</strong> Drug possession with intent to distribute</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9rem;">Both face potential 10-20 year sentences if convicted. Bail hearings scheduled for next week.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Bowling Green officials released a statement expressing "deep disappointment" in the situation and announcing an immediate suspension of the football program pending investigation. The NCAA has already indicated it will be launching its own inquiry into the matter.</p>

            <p>Boardingham, who had been a lock for a first-round NFL Draft pick just days ago, is now facing the prospect of missing the entire draft process and potentially prison time. Sources indicate his NFL future is in serious jeopardy, with teams already pulling their interest.</p>

                <h3>Reactions & Questions</h3>
                
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Will Diddy's coaching tenure end?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Are you kidding me? The man's in federal custody facing 20 years. Yeah, I'd say his coaching days at Bowling Green are over. The Bad Boy era at BGSU is officially dead." - Sports Commentator on ESPN</p>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: What happens to Arlis Boardingham's draft prospects?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Finished. Done. He was going to be a top-10 pick. Now he's looking at prison time. The NFL doesn't draft guys doing federal time. His million-dollar career is over before it started." - NFL Draft Analyst</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: How did this happen without warning?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Nobody saw this coming. Diddy was the golden boy of the dynasty. You've got to wonder what was really going on behind closed doors at Bowling Green. All those 'hands-on' coaching sessions... takes on a whole new meaning now." - College Football Insider</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: What about the other Bowling Green players?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"The program is suspended indefinitely. All games cancelled for the remainder of the season. Those players' scholarships are in limbo. It's a disaster for everyone involved." - Athletic Director Statement</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Does this affect the dynasty standings?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Who cares about standings when the coach and his star player are in prison? Colorado State's Thad Castle is probably laughing his ass off right now. Charlie Kirk's already tweeting about how 'this is what happens when you lose your values.' The dynasty is effectively over." - League Commissioner</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The CFB dynasty that seemed invincible just weeks ago has collapsed in spectacular fashion. With Diddy facing federal charges and Boardingham's NFL dreams shattered, the Bowling Green Falcons program faces an uncertain future. The coming weeks will determine whether either can mount a legal defense—though legal experts suggest their prospects are grim.</p>

            <p>This marks the end of an era for one of college football's most dominant programs. The dynasty is finished.</p>
