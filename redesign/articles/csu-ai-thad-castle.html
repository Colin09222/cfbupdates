        <h1 class="article-title">"F*** THE PLAYERS, WE'RE USING AI IN THIS B****" - Thad Castle Announces Revolutionary AI Roster After Dominating Utah State 56-49</h1>
        <img src="../images/thad-castle-ai-announcement.jpg" alt="Coach Thad Castle with visible cocaine residue" class="article-image">
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>FORT COLLINS, CO — In what can only be described as the most unhinged press conference in college football history, #17 Colorado State head coach Thad Castle showed up 40 minutes late to his postgame media availability with visible white powder on his nose and announced that he's replacing his entire roster with AI-powered robots. The Rams had just demolished Utah State 56-49 in a shootout that saw quarterback Jackson Brousseau throw for 666 yards and 6 touchdowns, but Castle spent zero seconds discussing the actual game and instead launched into a cocaine-fueled rant about artificial intelligence taking over his program.</p>
            
            <p>Colorado State's offensive explosion was nothing short of spectacular. The Rams racked up 679 total yards of offense, averaging an absurd 13.1 yards per play while converting on just 50% of their third downs. Brousseau completed 40 of 47 passes with only his usual chaos of interceptions scattered in. The ground game contributed 13 yards on 5 carries with 2 touchdowns. CSU led 21-14 at halftime before exploding in the second half, putting up 35 points to Utah State's 28. The victory improves the Rams to what appears to be playoff contention, though Castle's latest announcement may derail those hopes entirely.</p>
            
            <div class="score-box">
                <h3>Final Score</h3>
                <p><strong>#17 Colorado State: 56</strong></p>
                <p>Utah State: 49</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9rem;">CSU - J. Brousseau: 40/47, 666 YDS, 6 TD</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">CSU Total Offense: 679 yards (13.1 YPP)</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">CSU Rushing: 5-13-2 (5 carries, 13 yards, 2 TD)</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>When Castle finally stumbled to the podium — pupils the size of dinner plates, sniffing aggressively every 10 seconds, and sweating through his CSU polo — he immediately cut off the first question and launched into what can only be described as a drug-induced fever dream about ChatGPT linebackers and robotic running backs. "F*** humans, bro. F*** 'em. You know what doesn't ask for NIL money? A ROBOT. You know what doesn't get tired? ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE," he screamed while pounding the table. The entire coaching staff sat behind him in stunned silence, though offensive coordinator appeared to be nodding in agreement while clearly also on something.</p>
            
            <p>Athletic director Joe Parker immediately left the press conference and was seen making frantic phone calls in the hallway. Multiple sources confirm the NCAA is launching an investigation into whether AI-powered players violate eligibility rules, though one source noted "honestly we're more concerned about what the f*** Castle is on." When asked by a reporter if he had cocaine on his nose, Castle looked directly into the camera, wiped it with his finger, rubbed it on his gums, and said "that's dandruff, bro" before resuming his manifesto about robot quarterbacks who "don't complain about concussion protocols or whatever weak s*** humans cry about."</p>

You think Brousseau threw for 666 yards because he's human? NAH BRO. I've been replacing spinal fluid with nanobots since Week 8. He's 60% machine at this point. Kid doesn't even sleep anymore, he just plugs into a USB-C charger. THAT'S THE FUTURE." *wipes nose aggressively*</p>

ON FOOD? Robots don't eat! They run on ELECTRICITY! Do you know how cheap electricity is compared to feeding 85 18-year-olds? I'm talking MILLIONS in savings!

Next week we're rolling out AI cornerbacks. You can't burn what's been programmed with every route combination in history. Kirk and his racist a** out at Wyoming? His little white gym rat receivers? COOKED. Diddy and his creepy massage bulls***? My robot linebackers don't have nerve endings, they can't be 'massaged' into submission. HALF BACK TOSS. HALF BACK TOSS.

Depends how you define consciousness. He THINKS he's human. But I've been slipping nanobots into his Gatorade since August. Same with the receivers. The offensive line? Full robots since Week 3. You think humans can pass block like that? NAH. Those are hydraulic-powered titanium skeletons wrapped in synthetic skin. Cost me like $40 million but WORTH IT. And before you ask — yes, the cocaine helps me think clearly about all this. *taps temple* Enhanced cognitive function, bro."</p>

The year after? We upload their consciousness to the cloud so they can practice 24/7 in a simulation! THE YEAR AFTER THAT? *eyes bulging* WE TRANSCEND PHYSICAL FORM ENTIRELY AND JUST EXIST AS PURE FOOTBALL ENERGY! You're all gonna look back on this moment and say 'wow, Thad Castle was a visionary.' And I'll be on a beach somewhere, RICH AS F***, with my robot army winning natties on autopilot. Conference dismissed. *attempts to leave, walks into wall, corrects course, exits*"</p>
