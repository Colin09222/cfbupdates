        <img src="../images/kirk.jpg" alt="Coach Charlie Kirk at Press Conference" class="article-image">
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>LARAMIE, WY — In what can only be described as one of the most unhinged postgame press conferences in college football history, Wyoming head coach Charlie Kirk went on an extended tirade following the Cowboys' heartbreaking 34-31 loss to Fresno State on Saturday. What started as questions about the game quickly devolved into Kirk questioning the very foundations of American civil rights legislation.</p>
            
            <p>The game itself was a back-and-forth affair that saw Wyoming fall just short despite a valiant effort. Quarterback Kaden Anderson finished the game completing 16 of 32 passes for 243 yards, 1 touchdown, and 2 interceptions. The running game was the bright spot for the Cowboys, with Terron Kellman rushing for 216 yards and 3 touchdowns on 20 carries, including a 75-yard scamper. Wyoming out-gained Fresno State 466-330 in total offense and won the time of possession battle, but costly turnovers and what Kirk called "officiating by people who shouldn't be making decisions" doomed the Cowboys.</p>
            
            <div class="score-box">
                <h3>Final Score</h3>
                <p><strong>Fresno State: 34</strong></p>
                <p>Wyoming: 31</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9rem;">WYO - K. Anderson: 16/32, 243 YDS, 1 TD, 2 INT</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">WYO - T. Kellman: 20 CAR, 216 YDS, 3 TD, LONG 75</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">FRES - E. Warner: 23/41, 255 YDS, 3 TD, 0 INT</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Fresno State quarterback E.J. Warner was efficient in the victory, completing 23 of 41 passes for 255 yards and 3 touchdowns with no interceptions. The Bulldogs converted 5 of 12 third downs compared to Wyoming's 4 of 9, and ultimately made the plays when it mattered most. But according to Kirk, the outcome had nothing to do with football and everything to do with systemic issues dating back to 1964.</p>
            
            <p>The loss drops Wyoming to 2-2 on the season, with Kirk's seat getting progressively hotter not because of the losses, but because of his increasingly bizarre public statements. Athletic Director Tom Burman was seen leaving the press conference early with his head in his hands. Wyoming faces a crucial stretch of games coming up, and whether Kirk will be on the sideline for all of them remains to be seen.</p>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Coach, your thoughts on the loss today?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Look, I'm just going to say it. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a mistake. There, I said it. You want to know why we lost? Start there."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Coach, can you clarify what you mean by that?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"It's simple. Before 1964, teams knew their roles. Everyone stayed in their lane. Now you've got all this... mixing. My players are confused. They don't know if they should block or run routes because of DEI. The integration of responsibilities has destroyed football fundamentals."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Are you saying the Civil Rights Act affected today's game specifically?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Absolutely. Did you see those refs? Those are DEI hires. Every single flag against us was because of diversity quotas in officiating. You think those holding calls were legitimate? That's affirmative action in action, my friend."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Kaden Anderson threw two interceptions. Was that also related to civil rights?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"One hundred percent. Kaden is a victim of a system that has told him he needs to spread the ball around equally. Equal opportunity passing. You know what that leads to? Interceptions. In the old days, you threw to your best guy. Now there's pressure to include everyone. Participation trophy football."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Terron Kellman had over 200 yards rushing. That seems like a positive.</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Terron is proof that when you let talent shine without government interference, greatness happens. But the refs couldn't let that stand. They had to find ways to slow him down. Suspicious, don't you think?"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: What do you say to critics who will call these comments racist?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"I'm not racist. I have players of all backgrounds. I'm just asking questions that the liberal sports media won't ask. Why did we lose? Civil Rights Act. It's just facts. I'm a historian."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Do you have any actual football-related adjustments for next week?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"We're going to run more. The running game is pure. It's untouched by woke ideology. You just take the ball and run. No committee decisions, no diversity of routes. Just a man and his mission. That's the America I believe in."</p>
