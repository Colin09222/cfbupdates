        <div class="article-content">
            <p>NEW ORLEANS, LA — In one of the most chaotic, intoxicated, and somehow brilliant playoff performances in college football history, Colorado State head coach Thad Castle led his #1 seeded Rams to a heart-pounding 42-36 victory over LSU Thursday night in the CFP Quarterfinals. Castle, visibly inebriated throughout the game (Gatorade bottle in hand, likely spiked), orchestrated a furious fourth-quarter comeback that left LSU and the entire sports world speechless. Now, with Wyoming's Charlie Kirk and his pathetic Falcons watching from home after missing the playoffs entirely, Thad is turning his attention to Alabama—and he has thoughts.</p>

            <p>The game was a rollercoaster. LSU came out firing, jumping to a 24-14 halftime lead with an aggressive passing attack and creative red-zone schemes. Colorado State's defense looked vulnerable, and Castle appeared to be on the verge of one of the biggest playoff upsets in history. But in typical Thad fashion, he made halftime adjustments that only a cocaine-fueled genius could conceive. The Rams exploded for 28 second-half points while holding LSU to just 12, with running back Lloyd Avant turning into a machine with 89 rushing yards and 2 TDs in the final two quarters. Quarterback Tavien St. Clair threw for 312 yards and 3 TDs, including a dagger 4th-quarter drive that ended with a 2-yard TD pass to Jarrett Kingston with 1:47 remaining on the clock.</p>

            <p>Colorado State's defense, which had struggled early, absolutely suffocated LSU in the second half. The Rams sacked LSU quarterback Jaylen Johnson 5 times after the break, including a crucial strip-sack by defensive end Marcus Daniels with 6:12 left in the game that sealed Colorado State's comeback. The Rams' secondary, which allowed 187 yards in the first half, held LSU to just 41 yards passing in the second 24 minutes of play. It was a masterclass in adjustments—and likely Thad's drug-enhanced coaching brilliance at work.</p>

            <p>The most shocking part? Wyoming didn't even make the playoffs. Charlie Kirk's team, which started strong and had legitimate title aspirations, fell apart down the stretch. They finished 7-5 after losses to ranked teams (Clemson blew them out 42-21, Miami beat them 31-7, and they lost to Duke in overtime 35-27). With only two recruits committed for next year and a quarterback situation in complete disarray, Kirk's squad was relegated to the College Football Playoff Religation Bowl—a game nobody watches. Kirk, who spent most of the season flip-flopping between supporting Diddy, wearing durags, and obsessing over Israel, couldn't cobble together a cohesive football team. Thad has no sympathy.</p>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Coach Castle, how do you feel about that comeback?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"HALF BACK TOSS! HALF BACK TOSS!! That's how you win in the playoffs, baby! We were down, we were getting our ASSES handed to us, and then I said, 'Hold your cocks and play football!' And that's exactly what we did. Lloyd Avant ran through LSU like they owed him money. Tavien hit Kingston in the end zone when it MATTERED. This is PLAYOFF football, boys. This is what happens when you got COCAINE coaching and DETERMINATION! We're the number one seed, and we just showed everyone we belong here!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: What about Wyoming missing the playoffs?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Charlie Kirk? That clown? 7-5! SEVEN AND FIVE! How do you get into the playoffs at 7-5 with that bullshit schedule? Wyoming's a joke. Kirk spent all season dressing up like a cultural vulture—first he's wearing durags trying to be Black, then he's got a yarmulke talking about Israel. Meanwhile, his team can't even beat Duke at home! Duke! Colorado State just beat LSU by 6. Wyoming can't beat anybody. They're home watching us on TV. That's what happens when you're a fraud, baby. We're #1 for a REASON!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Thoughts on Bowling Green being overrated?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Bowling Green? Please. They beat TCU 36-7 and everyone's acting like they're Alabama. One good game against a mid Power 4 team and suddenly Arlis Boardingham is the next Gronk? Nah. I'll believe it when I see it in January. They haven't played anybody. We just came back from 10 down against LSU—a real program with real tradition. BGSU beat TCU and they're acting like they won the natty. Wait till they get to the Final Four and face a REAL team. Then we'll see if that tight end can catch balls when somebody's actually coaching defense. Diddy's running a circus down there, and that circus is about to get exposed."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <p class="qa-question">Q: Next up is Alabama. How do you prepare?</p>
                    <p class="qa-answer">"Alabama? *takes sip of Gatorade* Bring it on. We just beat LSU in their house. We're the number one seed for a reason. I'm gonna lock myself in the film room with a bottle of whatever I can find—Red Bull vodka, some Cîroc, maybe some whiskey—and I'm gonna break down Alabama's defense like it's a high school team. Bryce Young's their quarterback? Kid's good, but he hasn't faced a defense like ours. We're gonna hit him, we're gonna stack the box against their running game, and we're gonna score on every drive. This team believes. I believe. And when you got that in the playoffs, you beat ANYBODY. HALF BACK TOSS! *takes another sip* That's the gameplan right there. You got it?"</p>

            </div>

            <p>Thad Castle's Colorado State team is now one of four teams remaining in the College Football Playoff. With the #1 seed, a dominant second-half adjustment capability, and a head coach who operates on pure cocaine-fueled genius, the Rams are legitimate National Championship contenders. Wyoming's Charlie Kirk will be home, confused about which culture he belongs to. And Bowling Green will soon learn that beating TCU doesn't make you special—beating REAL teams in REAL playoff games does.</p>

            <p>The Semifinals await. Next stop: Saban's Dynasty vs. Thad's Chaos. And somehow, Thad's team of maniacs might just pull it off.</p>
